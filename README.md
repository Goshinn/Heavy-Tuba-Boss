# Heavy Tuba Gunner Boss Fight
Is a project that aims to create a reusable base for action combat games. Popular features such as dodge rolling, flinching, blocking and melee combo chains have been implemented here. The source code should provide clarity on how the Player Character and Boss Enemy is scripted, as well as how various gameplay systems interconnect and communicate with each other.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
I have unfortunately lost the FMOD Studio project (which this project depends on for audio), so sounds in this project will regrettably be broken ðŸ˜¢
